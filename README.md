<p> A centralization of Deep Learning projects </p>

Welcome to my GitHub profile ! The objective of my projects is to make Deep Learning more accessible, and provide real-world examples to enhance education and research in the field ! :yum:

The goal is to aggregate a wide range of Deep Learning topics in one place with a common abstraction, making it easier for you to dive into this fascinating field. Each repository not only focuses on a specific area of Deep Learning, but also includes links to tutorials and reference papers. These resources are carefully selected to help you grasp both the practical and theoretical aspects of Deep Learning, which can sometimes be challenging to find.

## Covered topics

Currently developped topics : 
- [x] [Image classification](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/base_dl_project) \*
- [x] [Object detection](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/detection)
- [x] [Siamese networks](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/siamese_networks)
- [x] [Speech-To-Text (STT)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/speech_to_text)
- [x] [Text-To-Speech (TTS)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/text_to_speech)
- [x] [Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/generation)
- [x] [Object segmentation](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/detection)
- [ ] [Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Masked Language Modeling (MLM)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/nlp)
- [x] [Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Question-Answering (Q&A)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/nlp)
- [ ] [Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Text Generation](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/nlp)
- [ ] [Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Translation](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/nlp)
- [x] [Optical Character Recognition (OCR)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/ocr)
- [ ] Reinforcment Learning (RL) for single-player games
- [ ] Reinforcment Learning (RL) for adversarial games

Additional utilities : 
- [x] [Custom losses / metrics / callbacks](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/base_dl_project)
- [x] [Dataset processing / analyzing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/base_dl_project)
- [x] [Plot / visualization utils](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Audio processing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Image processing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Text processing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Multi-threading framework](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)

Practical use cases :
- [x] [Speaker Verification (SV)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/encoders)
- [x] [Information Retrieval (IR)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/encoders)
- [ ] [Face Recognition](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/siamese_networks) : the code is available but the model is not performant enough yet
- [x] [Search text in audios / videos](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/speech_to_text)
- [x] [Live transcription / subtitle generation](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/speech_to_text) : some models tend to be accurate enough for transcription, like the `Whisper` family of models !
- [x] [Text-To-Speech logger](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/text_to_speech) : `logging`-based logger that reads your logs with `TTS` models
- [x] [Optical Character Recognition (OCR)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/ocr) : this projects allows to detect text in an image, and performs OCR on the detected text

All topics are released in separate repositories to make it easier to learn / experiments with dedicated codes and ressources.

\* It is a demonstration code to show how to subclass `BaseModel`. I will add a dedicated repository later for general classification (text / image / ...).
