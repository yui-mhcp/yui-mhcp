Welcome to my GitHub profile! The objective of my projects is to make Deep Learning more accessible, and provide real-world examples to enhance education and research in the field! :yum:

The goal is to aggregate a wide range of Deep Learning topics in one place with a common abstraction, making it easier for you to dive into this fascinating field. Each repository not only focuses on a specific area of Deep Learning, but also includes links to tutorials and reference papers. These resources are carefully selected to help you grasp both the practical and theoretical aspects of Deep Learning, which can sometimes be challenging to find.

## Covered topics

Currently developed topics: 
- [x] [Object/text detection](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/detection)
- [ ] [Encoder networks](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/encoders) \*
- [ ] [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/language_models) \*
- [x] [Optical Character Recognition (OCR)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/ocr)
- [x] [Speech-To-Text (STT)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/speech_to_text)
- [ ] [Text-To-Speech (TTS)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/text_to_speech) \*

Additional utilities: 
- [x] [Custom losses / metrics / callbacks](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/base_dl_project)
- [x] [Dataset processing / analyzing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Plot / visualization utilities](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Audio processing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Image processing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Text processing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Multi-threading framework](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)

Practical use cases:
- [ ] [Speaker Verification (SV)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/encoders) \*
- [ ] [Information Retrieval (IR)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/encoders) \*
- [ ] [Search text in audios / videos](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/speech_to_text) \*
- [ ] [Live transcription / subtitle generation](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/speech_to_text) \*
- [ ] [Text-To-Speech logger](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/text_to_speech): `logging`-based logger that reads your logs with `TTS` models \*
- [x] [Optical Character Recognition (OCR)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/ocr): this project allows to detect text in an image, and performs OCR on the detected text

All topics are released in separate repositories to make it easier to learn / experiment with dedicated code and resources.

\* These repositories/features are currently refactored, and are not working properly yet. They will be updated in the next release :smile:
