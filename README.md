- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @yui-mhcp
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in practical usage of Artificial Intelligence (and more specifically Deep Learning)
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Computer Sciences
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on Deep-Learning projects on TTS, Q&A or other funny topics ! :smile:
- üì´ You can ping me if you have question or send me an email if you want to collaborate on a new project :smile:

The objective of this project is to propose many utilities to create, train, monitor and experiment models / architectures by tracking all configuration for reproducibility / comparison. 

Note that many of projects / models already exist on GitHub (and some of my projects are highly inspired of some of them). The idea is to centralize all different topics and provide abstract class\* / utilities to facilitate development of new models, training, testing and deployment. 

\* The core of all projects is the `BaseModel` class described in [this project](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/base_dl_project) which is the base of all other projects.

## Type of projects

Currently handled topics : 
- [x] [Image classification](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/base_dl_project)
- [x] [Object detection](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/detection)
- [x] [Siamese networks](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/siamese_networks)
- [x] [Speaker Verification (SV)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/siamese_networks)
- [x] [Text-To-Speech (TTS)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/text_to_speech)
- [x] [Speech-To-Text (STT)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/speech_to_text)
- [x] [Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/generation)
- [ ] Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Question-Answering (Q&A)
- [ ] Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Translation
- [ ] Reinforcment Learning (RL) for single-player games
- [ ] Reinforcment Learning (RL) for adversarial games

Additional utilities : 
- [x] [Custom losses / metrics / callbacks](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/base_dl_project)
- [x] [Dataset processing / analyzing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/base_dl_project)
- [x] [Plot / visualization utils](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Audio processing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Image processing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Text processing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)

All projects are in separate repositories so that it will be easier to contribute to a particular topic without carrying about other projects


## Objectives and applications

The main objective of this github is to democratize Deep Learning to facilitate its usage in **real-world projects**

The main idea is to **centralize many Deep Learning topics** to facilitate their learning. 
Furthermore, for each repository, I will try to put some **tutorial links** in order to give you some good tutorials to start this topic and learn theorical aspects of them (which can be quite hard for some of them :smile: ).  

I will also develop some applications with these repositories and will try to make them open-source as well (and always with free version) to give example of powerful, funny and helpful usage of DeepLearning even without big computational power !

If you create useful / funny concrete application with one of these project (or without), please contact me so I can reference them here ! :smile: It can give it more visibility and show example of real-world usage of Deep Learning methods 

If you have ideas of usage / interesting application but do not have time / experience to do it, you can also contact me to add them and see if someone can help you to develop it

### Available applications

No application yet, do not hesitate to contact me :smile:

### Application ideas

No shared idea yet, do not hesitate to contact me :smile:

## Contacts and licence

You can contact [me](https://github.com/yui-mhcp) at yui-mhcp@tutanota.com or on [discord](https://discord.com) at `yui#0732`

The objective of these projects is to facilitate the development and deployment of useful application using Deep Learning for solving real-world problems and helping people. 
For this purpose, all the code is under the [GNU GPL v3 licence](LICENCE)

Furthermore, you **cannot** use any of these projects for commercial purpose without my permission. You can use, modify, distribute and use any of my projects for production as long as you respect the terms of the [licence](LICENCE) and use it for non-commercial purposes (i.e. free applications / research). 

If you use this project in your work, please cite this project to give it more visibility ! :smile:
