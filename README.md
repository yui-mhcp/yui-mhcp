- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @yui-mhcp ! :yum:
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in practical usage of Artificial Intelligence (and more specifically Deep Learning)
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Computer Sciences
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on Deep Learning projects on TTS, Q&A or other funny topics ! :smile:
- üì´ You can ping me if you have question or send me an email / Discord message if you want to collaborate on a new project :smile:

:yum: **I have added 2 generated audios to wish you all the best for this new year !** :yum:

The objective of this github is to propose many utilities to create, train, monitor and experiment models / architectures by tracking all configuration for reproducibility / comparison. 

Note that many projects / models already exist on GitHub (and some of my projects are highly inspired of some of them). The idea is to centralize all different topics and provide abstract class\* / utilities to facilitate development, training, testing and deployment of (new) models. 

\* The core of all projects is the `BaseModel` class described in [this project](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/base_dl_project) which is the base of all other projects.

## Type of projects

Currently handled topics : 
- [x] [Image classification](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/base_dl_project)
- [x] [Object detection](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/detection)
- [x] [Siamese networks](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/siamese_networks)
- [x] [Speech-To-Text (STT)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/speech_to_text)
- [x] [Text-To-Speech (TTS)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/text_to_speech)
- [x] [Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/generation)
- [ ] [Object segmentation](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/detection)
- [ ] Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
- [ ] Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Question-Answering (Q&A)
- [ ] Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Text Generation
- [ ] Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Translation
- [ ] Reinforcment Learning (RL) for single-player games
- [ ] Reinforcment Learning (RL) for adversarial games

Additional utilities : 
- [x] [Custom losses / metrics / callbacks](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/base_dl_project)
- [x] [Dataset processing / analyzing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/base_dl_project)
- [x] [Plot / visualization utils](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Audio processing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Image processing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)
- [x] [Text processing](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/data_processing)

All topics are in separate repositories so that it is easier to contribute to a particular topic without carrying about other projects


## Objectives and applications

The main objective of this github is to democratize Deep Learning to facilitate its usage in **real-world projects**

The main idea is to **centralize many Deep Learning topics** to facilitate their learning. 
Furthermore, for each repository, I will try to put some **tutorial / references links** in order to give you some good tools to start this topic and learn theorical aspects of them (which can be quite hard to find for some of them :smile: ).  

I will also develop some applications / features with these repositories and will try to make them open-source as well (and always with free version) to give example of powerful, funny and helpful usage of Deep Learning even without big computational power !

If you create useful / funny concrete application with one of these project (or without), please contact me so I can reference them here ! :smile: It can give it more visibility and show example of real-world usage of Deep Learning methods 

If you have ideas of usage / interesting application but do not have time / experience to develop it, you can also contact me to add them and see if someone can help you to develop it

### Available features

- [x] [Speaker Verification (SV)](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/siamese_networks)
- [x] [Search text in audios / videos](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/speech_to_text).
- [x] [Text-To-Speech logger](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/text_to_speech) : `logging`-based logger that converts your logs to speech.

### Available applications

- [Ezcast with STT](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/ezcast) : video player with additional `Speech-To-Text (STT)` support allowing to search text in videos !

### Application / features ideas

- [Face recognition](https://github.com/yui-mhcp/siamese_networks)

## Contacts and licence

You can contact [me](https://github.com/yui-mhcp) at yui-mhcp@tutanota.com or on [discord](https://discord.com) at `yui#0732`
